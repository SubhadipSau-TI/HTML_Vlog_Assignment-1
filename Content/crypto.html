      cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of
      payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption
      technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and
      as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a
      cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based
      service or is stoblack on your computer or on your mobile device. The
      wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that
      confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.
